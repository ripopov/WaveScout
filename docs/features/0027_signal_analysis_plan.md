# Signal Analysis Feature Specification

## 1. User Stories and Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Feature Overview
The Signal Analysis feature enables users to compute statistical measurements (Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Average) for selected signals. Analysis can be performed either using a fixed sampling period or synchronized with a sampling signal's transitions. The analysis scope can be global (entire waveform) or constrained between the first two markers.

### 1.2 Core User Stories

#### Story 1: Sampling Signal Selection
**As a** digital design engineer  
**I want to** designate a specific signal as my sampling clock  
**So that** I can analyze other signals synchronized to my system clock or control signal

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Right-click context menu in Signal Names panel shows "Set as Sampling Signal" option
- Only one sampling signal can be active at a time
- Selecting a new sampling signal replaces the previous one
- Sampling signal selection persists across session save/restore
- Visual indicator shows which signal is the current sampling signal (optional enhancement)
- Sampling behavior depends on signal type:
  - 1-bit wire signals: Sample on positive edges only (clock-like behavior)
  - Bus signals: Sample on any value change
  - Event signals: Sample on every event occurrence

#### Story 2: Analysis Interval Selection
**As a** waveform analyst  
**I want to** analyze signals either globally or between specific markers  
**So that** I can focus on regions of interest in my waveform

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- If 0 or 1 markers exist: Analysis uses full waveform time range
- If 2+ markers exist: Analysis can use interval between Marker 1 and Marker 2
- User can choose between "Global" and "Marker A-B" modes in the analysis window

#### Story 3: Triggering Analysis
**As a** user  
**I want to** quickly start signal analysis on selected signals  
**So that** I can get measurements without disrupting my workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Context menu "Analyze" option appears for selected signals
- Keyboard shortcut 'A'/'a' triggers analysis for selected signals
- Analysis window opens as a modal dialog
- Multiple signals can be analyzed simultaneously

#### Story 4: Configuring Analysis Parameters
**As a** user  
**I want to** choose between sampling signal or fixed period sampling  
**So that** I can analyze signals in the most appropriate way for my use case

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Radio buttons allow switching between "Sampling Signal" and "Sampling Period" modes
- Sampling Signal mode shows dropdown with all available signals
- Sampling Period mode shows text input for numeric period value
- Previously selected sampling signal (if any) appears as default in dropdown
- Input validation ensures period is positive number

#### Story 5: Viewing Analysis Results
**As a** user  
**I want to** see analysis results in a clear tabular format  
**So that** I can quickly understand signal characteristics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Table displays: Signal Name, Min, Max, Sum, Average columns
- One row per selected signal
- Values initially empty, populated after analysis completes
- Table rows are selectable and copyable (for paste to external tools)
- Table is read-only (no editing allowed)

#### Story 6: Non-blocking Analysis
**As a** user  
**I want to** continue using the application while analysis runs  
**So that** I don't have to wait for long computations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analysis runs asynchronously without freezing UI
- Progress bar shows analysis progress
- "Start Analysis" button initiates computation
- Results update table as they complete
- Cancel option available during analysis (enhancement)

### 1.3 Detailed Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Sampling Signal Management**
   - Add `sampling_signal: Optional[SignalNode] = None` to WaveformSession
   - Ensure sampling_signal persists in YAML session files
   - Validate sampling signal is still valid after session restore

2. **Analysis Computation**
   - Support two sampling modes:
     - Fixed period: Sample at regular time intervals
     - Signal-based: Sample based on sampling signal transitions
       * For buses: Sample on every value change
       * For event signals: Sample on every event occurrence
       * For 1-bit wire signals: Sample only on positive edges (0â†’1 transitions)
   - Compute four metrics:
     - Minimum value across all samples
     - Maximum value across all samples
     - Sum of all sampled values
       - Average (arithmetic mean) of sampled values
   - Handle different signal types using parse_signal_value():
     - Digital signals: Returns 0.0 or 1.0 in value_float
     - Multi-bit buses: Converted to float based on data format (signed/unsigned/hex/binary)
     - Analog signals: Direct float values
     - All analysis uses parse_signal_value() from signal_sampling module
     - Ensures consistency with waveform rendering pipeline

3. **Interval Selection**
   - Use existing marker system (no changes needed)
   - If markers.length >= 2: Use markers[0].time to markers[1].time
   - Otherwise: Use 0 to waveform.total_duration

4. **UI Components**
   - Modal dialog window (QDialog)
   - Two-option radio button group for sampling mode
   - Dropdown (QComboBox) for signal selection
   - Line edit (QLineEdit) for period input
   - Table widget (QTableWidget) for results
   - Progress bar (QProgressBar) for status
   - Start button (QPushButton) to initiate

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Analysis must not block main UI thread
   - Support cancellation of long-running analysis
   - Efficient sampling for large waveforms (millions of samples)

2. **Usability**
   - Clear visual feedback during analysis
   - Intuitive mode selection
   - Copy-paste support for results

3. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid period input validation
   - Handle missing sampling signal gracefully
   - Warn if selected signals cannot be analyzed

## 2. Codebase Research

   - Emits progress updates and results

4. **Core Analysis Algorithm:**
   ```
   For each selected signal:
     1. Determine analysis interval (global or markers)
     2. Get sampling points:
        - If period mode: Generate regular intervals
        - If signal mode: 
          * Check sampling signal type (bus/event/1-bit wire)
          * For bus/event: Get all transitions of sampling signal
          * For 1-bit wire: Get only positive edges (0â†’1 transitions)
     3. For each sampling point:
        - Get signal value at that time
        - Parse using parse_signal_value(value, signal.format.data_format, bit_width)
        - Extract value_float from returned tuple
        - Skip NaN values (undefined/high-impedance)
        - Update min/max/sum/count with valid values
     4. Calculate average = sum / count
     5. Emit result for this signal
   ```

### 3.5 Analysis Engine

#### New File: `wavescout/analysis_engine.py`
**Core Analysis Functions:**

1. **compute_signal_statistics()**
   - Parameters: `waveform_db`, `signal_node`, `sampling_times`, `start_time`, `end_time`
   - Returns: Dict with min, max, sum, average
   - Uses `parse_signal_value()` from `wavescout.signal_sampling`:
     * Reuses existing value parsing logic from rendering pipeline
     * Calls with signal's data_format and bit_width parameters
     * Extracts value_float from returned tuple for statistics
     * Ensures consistency with how values are displayed in waveform viewer
     * Returns float values for all statistics

2. **generate_sampling_times()**
   - For period mode: Generate regular intervals
   - For signal mode: 
     * Determine signal type via waveform_db.var_from_handle()
     * For buses (bitwidth > 1): Extract all transition times
     * For event signals: Extract all event occurrence times
     * For 1-bit wires: Extract only positive edge times (filter transitions where value changes from '0' to '1')
   - Filters times within analysis interval

3. **sample_signal_value()**
   - Gets signal value at specific time
   - Uses `parse_signal_value()` from `wavescout.signal_sampling` module:
     * Same function used for signal rendering - ensures consistency
     * Returns tuple of (value_str, value_float, value_bool)
     * Uses the value_float component for all statistical calculations
     * Handles all data formats (UNSIGNED, SIGNED, HEX, BIN, FLOAT)
     * Returns NaN for undefined/high-impedance values
   - Statistics computation skips NaN values

### 3.6 Integration Points

1. **Persistence (wavescout/persistence.py)**
   - No changes needed - sampling_signal automatically saved
   - Validate on restore that signal still exists

2. **Event System**
   - Add "sampling_signal_changed" event type
   - Emit when sampling signal changes

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
