"""Test that WaveformCanvas properly syncs when nodes are deleted.

This module specifically tests the synchronization between the WaveformCanvas 
rendering component and the data model when nodes are deleted. Unlike the 
integration tests in test_delete_integration.py, these tests focus on the 
internal state of the canvas to ensure proper cleanup and rendering updates.

Key Testing Focus:
- Canvas's _visible_nodes list maintenance
- Proper removal of deleted nodes from rendering pipeline
- Hierarchical deletion (groups with children)
- Canvas state consistency after deletion operations

Why This Matters:
The WaveformCanvas maintains its own list of visible nodes for efficient 
rendering. When nodes are deleted from the data model, the canvas must:
1. Remove the deleted nodes from its internal tracking
2. Update any cached rendering data
3. Ensure no stale references remain that could cause rendering errors

Test Scenarios:
1. Individual node deletion - Verify single nodes are removed from canvas
2. Group deletion - Ensure groups and all children are removed together

Technical Details:
- Directly calls widget._delete_selected_nodes() for focused testing
- Examines canvas._visible_nodes internal state
- Uses processEvents() to ensure signal propagation
- Complements integration tests by verifying implementation details

This is a white-box test that validates the canvas component's internal 
behavior, ensuring the rendering layer stays synchronized with the data model.
