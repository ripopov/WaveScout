"""Test VCD alias handling - multiple variables referencing the same signal.

In VCD files, multiple hierarchical paths can reference the same underlying signal 
through aliases. For example, in swerv1.vcd:
- TOP.core_clk 
- TOP.tb_top.core_clk
Both use the same VCD identifier '|s', making them aliases of the same signal.

This test verifies that:
1. Aliases are detected and share the same handle
2. Both aliases can be added to the waveform display
3. Both render correctly in the canvas
4. Sessions save/load with correct shared handles
5. Signal data is loaded only once for efficiency
